## Features

1. **Disease Prediction**
   - Powered by a machine learning model trained on comprehensive datasets.
   - Predicts diseases based on symptoms entered by the user.

2. **Health Guidance**
   - Provides disease descriptions, medications, dietary advice, precautions, and workout recommendations.

3. **Speech Recognition**
   - Enables voice input for entering symptoms using the Web Speech API.

4. **Interactive Blog**
   - Offers health-related blog posts to keep users informed and educated.

5. **PDF Prescription Report**
   - Generates a downloadable PDF report with the predicted disease, precautions, medications, diets, and workouts.

## System Architecture

1. **User Input:** Users can input symptoms via text or speech.
2. **Prediction Engine:** Symptoms are processed by a Decision Tree Classifier model to predict potential diseases.
3. **Data Retrieval:** Relevant data (e.g., medications, precautions) is fetched from CSV datasets.
4. **Output:** Results are displayed on the web interface and a downloadable prescription PDF is generated.
